Are you waiting on a lightening strike
Are you waiting for the perfect night
Are you waiting till the time is right?
What are you waiting for?

Are you waiting for the right excuse?
Are you waiting for a sign to choose
While your waiting it's the time you lose
What are you waiting for?
Don't you wanna spread your wings and fly?
