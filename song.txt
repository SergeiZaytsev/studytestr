Are you waiting on a lightening strike
Are you waiting for the perfect night
Are you waiting till the time is right?
What are you waiting for?

Are you waiting for the right excuse?
Are you waiting for a sign to choose
While your waiting it's the time you lose
What are you waiting for?
Don't you wanna spread your wings and fly?

Everybody's gonna make mistakes
But everybody's got a choice to make
Everybody needs a leap of faith
When are you taking yours?

You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you got
You only living one so tell me?
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you gotta give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall
You only living one so tell me?
What are you, what are you waiting for?
